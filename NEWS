Version 1.0.0
Fixed the indexing of the demo latticeDensity
Modified the function makeTmatrix so that the function
  runs even if some nodes have no links to the rest of
  the lattice.
homerange now prints out the area of the homerange along with
  the proportion of the region that is inside the homerange.
--------------------
Version 1.0.4  (June 6, 2011)
Many new items in this version.  Non-parametric regression has been
implemented.  
Many function names have been shortened (somewhat).  
New functions include addQuantVar to add a spatial response variable to
a non-parametric regression, crossvalNparReg to crossvalidate the
non-parametric regression, createNparReg to perform the smoothing and
predict.NparRegOut and plot.NparRegOut to produce predictions and plots
for non-parametric regression.
The package passes R CMD check, the demo runs properly, editLattice works
and the help files are in fairly good shape.
*This was the first version submitted and accepted at the CRAN repository.
-------------------
Version 1.0.5  (June 7, 2011)
Two examples in help files were improved (makeTmatrix and Tkp).
Almost all examples were sped up so the checking process will run faster,
usually by decreasing the number of steps checked under crossvalidation and
by using a coarser grid.
The components of the output of crossvalDensity were named ucv and k.
