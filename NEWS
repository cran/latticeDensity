Version 1.0.0
Fixed the indexing of the demo latticeDensity
Modified the function makeTmatrix so that the function
  runs even if some nodes have no links to the rest of
  the lattice.
homerange now prints out the area of the homerange along with
  the proportion of the region that is inside the homerange.
--------------------
Version 1.0.4  (June 6, 2011)
Many new items in this version.  Non-parametric regression has been
implemented.  
Many function names have been shortened (somewhat).  
New functions include addQuantVar to add a spatial response variable to
a non-parametric regression, crossvalNparReg to crossvalidate the
non-parametric regression, createNparReg to perform the smoothing and
predict.NparRegOut and plot.NparRegOut to produce predictions and plots
for non-parametric regression.
The package passes R CMD check, the demo runs properly, editLattice works
and the help files are in fairly good shape.
*This was the first version submitted and accepted at the CRAN repository.
-------------------
Version 1.0.5  (June 7, 2011)
Two examples in help files were improved (makeTmatrix and Tkp).
Almost all examples were sped up so the checking process will run faster,
usually by decreasing the number of steps checked under crossvalidation and
by using a coarser grid.
The components of the output of crossvalDensity were named ucv and k.
-------------------
Version 1.0.6  (June 22, 2011)
The predict.NparRegOut function was improved to make predictions at new
locations.  Homerange now has the option of output of node locations with
a column that identifies the homerange.  Finally, a new function 
deletedResid produces a column of residuals and deleted residuals for each
observed response.
This version was submitted to CRAN.
-------------------
Version 1.0.7  (Jan. 6, 2011)
When an array with unnamed columns was used as a boundary in nodeFilling,
a warning was generated due to the columns not being labeled x and y.  This
even caused a warning to occur in the demo(density), though it did not
affect results.  I fixed the error.
This version was submitted to CRAN.
-------------------
Version 1.1.0 (Aug. 16, 2018)
The latticeDensity package was extensively reworked, though most changes
were internal.
1)  Automated all documentation using roxygen
2)  Added vignette
3)  Improved DESCRIPTION file, removed 'requires' from files
4)  Changed naming convention of functions and objects, especially
to remove yyy.yyy names.
5)  added deletedResid function for deleted residuals
6)  removed most side-effects of functions
7)  used ptinpoly package to improve selection of nodes inside polygons,
    and the RANN package to find nearest
    neighbors.
8)  improved speed of nodeFilling.
9)  added an estimator of the sum of squared error (based on deleted
    residuals)
10)  improved look of plot.formLatticeOutput
11)  Added a set of automated tests
12)  added a function to compute Nardaraya-Watson estimated variance
     maps (varianceMap)
This version was submitted to CRAN
---------------------
Version 1.1.1 (July 9, 2018)
The function as.spam.listw was moved from the package spdep to
the package spatialreg.  In order to load both packages,
I used inputFrom to avoid namespace clashes.
Version submitted to CRAN
---------------------
Version 1.1.2 (May 7, 2020)
Fixed cran check errors (caused by ... argument in nodeFilling documentation)
Changed to LazyData: true
--------------------
Version 1.1.6 (May 8, 2020)
Removed the variable ".Random.seed" from a data set.  Was causing a CRAN build NOTE.
Removed the variable ".Random.seed" from internal.R file.
