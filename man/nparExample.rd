\title{Example boundary with a grid of locations}
\description{
The first item, \code{polygon2}, is 35x2 matrix describing the boundary of 
a region.  The second, \code{grid2}, is a set of 59 locations for simulated
values of a response variable.  The third item, \code{Z}, is a vector of
responses.  This dataset was created to test and
illustrate the non-parametric lattice based regression estimator.  See the
example for function \code{createNparReg}.
